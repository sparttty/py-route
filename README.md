# py-route
Orienteering route analysis

Run py-route to load the GUI and do the work.

Only support GPX file generated by Garmin for now (due to some 0s added to the "second" digit by different software).

Right click on the map to pick calibration point. Lattitude and longitude data needs to be input manually.
